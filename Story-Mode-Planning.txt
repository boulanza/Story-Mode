|        SUMMARY        |
-------------------------
Story Mode is a simulation program that generates a classic RPG story
line. It will generate the main character, their side characters, plot
points, etc.

Remaining points of completion are highlighted below.


-------------------------
|  Character Generator  |
-------------------------
this will generate a character for this story

- generate lists
    - names
    - classes
    - species
    - appearance
    - titles
    - personality traits
    - skills
- selector / creator (create the character by selecting from lists)

- initially have it select completely randomly
- eventually make sure it makes logical choices
    - e.g. certain species will have certain naming styles / classes,
      appearances need to match species, personality traits shouldn't
      conflict, etc.
    - improve to take inputs about the world/locations

- create distinction between main characters and NPCs
    - e.g. make NPC generator simpler

- create system to keep track of what topics a character is
  knowledgeable about

- generate history of character

-------------------------
|  Location  Generator  |
-------------------------
this will generate the world the story takes place in

- generate continents
- generate climates
- generate countries / regions
- generate "major locations"
- select names of places from lists of possible names

- initially it should just generate them
    - perhaps a very simple version of a map

- eventually generate a full-fledged grid map
    - possibly with it selecting types of terrain for each "square"
      in the grid based on probabilities of what it should make them.
      that way the world is truly randomly generated.

- in accordance with the knowledge system for characters, give each
  major city / country a focus or thing its famous for

-------------------------
|  Plot Line Generator  |
-------------------------
this will be the main section of the program, controlling the other
sections and driving the story itself

- "problem" generator
- "solution" generator

- story generation
    - do all initial generation
    - generate multiple "quest" paths to achieve the general goal
    - generate potential party characters and give them a "trigger"
      that lets the main character meet them
    - start having character make decisions on following quest paths
        - this will (eventually) be decided based on everything "known"
          to main character (skills, knowledge, location, relations,
          inventory, previous paths, etc)
    - continue choosing paths and playing out those mini stories until
      goal is achieved

-------------------------
|  Relations Generator  |
-------------------------
this will control relations between characters, both in the past and
present

- relations of the past should be achieved by generating character
  history (apply relations during this process)
- control relations between characters based on choices, personality,
  etc
